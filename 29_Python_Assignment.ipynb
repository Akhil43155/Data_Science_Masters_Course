    "\tPython is a multi-paradigm programming language, which means it supports several programming paradigms, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Python supports OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imperative Programming - This programming style is based on giving the computer a sequence of tasks to perform, using statements that change a program's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Programming - Python has functions, first-class objects, and closures, which enable functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural Programming - This programming style is based on a sequence of procedures, or subroutines, which tell the computer what tasks to perform. Python supports procedural programming with its procedure-oriented features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripting - Python can be used as a scripting language to automate tasks, write small programs, or prototype larger systems.\n",

    "Ans. In Python, memory management is handled automatically by the interpreter through a mechanism known as garbage collection. Garbage collection is the process of identifying and freeing up memory that is no longer being used by the program, in order to prevent memory leaks and other issues that can arise from excessive memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a technique called reference counting to keep track of objects and their associated memory. Each object in memory has a reference count that indicates how many references (variables, function arguments, etc.) are currently pointing to that object. When an object's reference count drops to zero, it is no longer being used and its memory can be freed up by the garbage collector.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to reference counting, Python also employs a cycle-detecting garbage collector that can detect and break cycles of objects that reference each other, but are not referenced by any other parts of the program. This helps to prevent memory leaks that can occur when objects remain in memory even though they are no longer being used.\n",
