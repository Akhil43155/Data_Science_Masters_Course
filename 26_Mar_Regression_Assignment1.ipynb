    "Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable. It involves estimating the coefficients of a linear equation that best fits the observed data. In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable used to predict the dependent variable. For example, we may use simple linear regression to model the relationship between a student's grade (dependent variable) and their hours of study (independent variable).\n",

    "Linear regression relies on several assumptions, which should be met in order to obtain valid and reliable results. The assumptions are as follows:\n",

    "Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and each independent variable is linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations are independent of each other.\n",

    "No multicollinearity: The independent variables are not highly correlated with each other.\n",

    "\n",
    "Linearity: Plotting the dependent variable against each independent variable can help detect non-linear relationships. A scatter plot with a clear linear pattern indicates linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations should be collected independently of each other. For example, in a time series dataset, autocorrelation plots can be used to detect the presence of any dependence between observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: A scatter plot of residuals against fitted values can help to detect any heteroscedasticity. If the points are evenly distributed and show no pattern, homoscedasticity is assumed.\n",

    "Normality: A histogram of residuals or a normal probability plot can be used to check the normality assumption. If the residuals are normally distributed, the plot should show a straight line.\n",

    "In a linear regression model, the slope and intercept represent the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The slope measures the rate of change in the dependent variable for each unit change in the independent variable, while the intercept represents the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero.\n",

    "For example, suppose we want to investigate the relationship between a person's age (independent variable) and their blood pressure (dependent variable). We collect data on 50 individuals and fit a linear regression model. The output shows that the intercept is 120 and the slope is 1.5. This means that for each additional year of age, the person's blood pressure is expected to increase by 1.5 units. Additionally, the intercept of 120 indicates that a person with age 0 would have a blood pressure of 120 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world scenarios, the interpretation of the slope and intercept will depend on the units of measurement used for the independent and dependent variables. For example, if we were investigating the relationship between a person's height (independent variable) and their weight (dependent variable), the units would be important in interpreting the slope and intercept. If height was measured in centimeters and weight in kilograms, the slope would represent the expected change in weight (in kilograms) for each additional centimeter in height, and the intercept would represent the expected weight of a person with height 0 (which is not meaningful in this case).\n",

    "Gradient descent is a commonly used optimization algorithm in machine learning that is used to find the parameters of a model that minimize a cost function. It works by iteratively adjusting the parameters of a model in the direction of steepest descent of the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea of gradient descent is to start with an initial set of parameter values and update them iteratively until the cost function is minimized. In each iteration, the gradient (i.e., the partial derivative) of the cost function with respect to each parameter is calculated, and the parameters are updated by taking a step in the opposite direction of the gradient. The step size, or learning rate, determines the magnitude of the update at each iteration.\n",

    "Gradient descent can be classified into three types based on the amount of data that is used for each update:\n",

    "Batch gradient descent: In this type, the entire dataset is used to calculate the gradient at each iteration. Batch gradient descent is computationally efficient, but it can be slow for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic gradient descent: In this type, a single randomly selected example from the dataset is used to calculate the gradient at each iteration. Stochastic gradient descent is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets, but it can be noisy and may take longer to converge to the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mini-batch gradient descent: In this type, a small random sample of the dataset is used to calculate the gradient at each iteration. Mini-batch gradient descent is a compromise between batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent, offering both computational efficiency and convergence speed.\n",
