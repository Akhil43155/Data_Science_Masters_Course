    "Grid search CV (Cross-validation) is a hyperparameter optimization technique that is commonly used in machine learning to find the optimal hyperparameters of a model. The purpose of grid search CV is to systematically explore a range of hyperparameter values for a given model and identify the hyperparameters that produce the best performance on a validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV works by creating a grid of hyperparameter values and training and evaluating the model for each combination of hyperparameters in the grid. The hyperparameter grid can be defined using a list of possible values or a range of values. For example, if we are tuning the hyperparameters of a decision tree model, we can define a hyperparameter grid that includes the maximum depth of the tree, the minimum number of samples required to split a node, and the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid search algorithm then trains and evaluates the model for each combination of hyperparameters in the grid using k-fold cross-validation. In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is split into k equal-sized folds, and the model is trained and evaluated k times using different subsets of the data. The performance of the model is then averaged across the k folds to obtain a more robust estimate of the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the grid search algorithm has evaluated all the hyperparameter combinations, it selects the hyperparameters that produce the best performance on the validation set. The best hyperparameters can then be used to train the final model on the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV is a powerful technique for hyperparameter optimization because it systematically explores the hyperparameter space and identifies the optimal hyperparameters for a given model. However, it can be computationally expensive if the hyperparameter space is large, and it may not always find the global optimum. Therefore, it is important to carefully define the hyperparameter grid and balance the trade-off between computational cost and hyperparameter search space.\n",

    "Grid search CV and random search CV are two common hyperparameter tuning techniques used in machine learning. The main difference between them lies in how they search the hyperparameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV works by exhaustively searching the entire hyperparameter space defined by the user, while random search CV randomly samples hyperparameters from a defined distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV is suitable when we have a small number of hyperparameters to tune and the hyperparameters have a relatively small range of values. In this case, grid search can perform an exhaustive search of the hyperparameter space and identify the optimal set of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random search CV is more suitable when we have a large number of hyperparameters to tune, and the hyperparameters have a wide range of possible values. Random search can efficiently explore the hyperparameter space by randomly sampling hyperparameters from a defined distribution. By exploring a diverse set of hyperparameters, random search can often find better hyperparameter values than grid search with fewer iterations.\n",

    "In summary, grid search CV is more suitable for small hyperparameter search spaces, while random search CV is more suitable for larger and more complex hyperparameter search spaces. The choice of technique will depend on the specifics of the problem and the number and range of hyperparameters being tuned."

    "Data leakage occurs when there is a relationship between the predictors and the target variable in the validation or test set that is not present in the training set. This can occur when features that are not available at the time of prediction are used to train the model, or when the data is split in a way that leaks information from the training set into the validation or test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we are building a model to predict whether a customer will default on their loan payments. We have a dataset that includes the customer's credit score, income, and employment status, as well as whether or not they have defaulted on their loan in the past. However, the dataset also includes a variable that indicates whether the customer was contacted by the bank before the loan was issued. This variable may be a proxy for the bank's assessment of the customer's creditworthiness, and therefore, it should not be used as a predictor in the model. If this variable is included in the model, it will lead to overly optimistic estimates of model performance, as the model will be exploiting information that is not available at the time of prediction.\n",

    "Use only relevant variables: Only use variables that are relevant to the problem at hand to train the model. Variables that are not directly related to the target variable or those that can cause data leakage should be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separate training and validation/test sets properly: Ensure that the data is split into training and validation/test sets in a way that avoids data leakage. Ideally, the data should be split randomly, and each observation should be included in only one of the sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique that can help prevent data leakage by splitting the data into multiple subsets and performing multiple train-test splits. This technique ensures that each observation is used for both training and testing, but never at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid using future information: Avoid using information that would not be available at the time of prediction. For example, if we are building a model to predict whether a customer will default on their loan payments, we should not use the customer's payment history after the loan was issued.\n",
