    "In mathematics, a projection is a linear transformation that maps a vector onto a subspace, preserving its direction. In other words, it \"projects\" the vector onto the subspace. In PCA (Principal Component Analysis), projections are used to represent data in a lower-dimensional space, by projecting it onto a set of orthogonal axes called principal components.\n",

    "PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that aims to reduce the number of variables in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible. It does this by identifying the principal components of the data, which are linear combinations of the original variables that capture the maximum amount of variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform PCA, we first compute the covariance matrix of the data, which tells us how the different variables are related to each other. We then find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, which correspond to the principal components and the amount of variance that each component explains, respectively. Finally, we project the data onto the principal components to obtain a lower-dimensional representation of the data.\n",

    "The projection onto the principal components is a linear transformation that maps the original data onto a new coordinate system defined by the principal components. This transformation preserves the relative distances and directions between data points, but reduces the dimensionality of the data. The projection onto the first principal component captures the direction of maximum variance in the data, and each subsequent principal component captures the remaining variance in decreasing order. By choosing a subset of the principal components, we can obtain a lower-dimensional representation of the data that retains most of the information."
