The idea behind ensemble methods is that when multiple models are combined, the strengths of each model can offset the weaknesses of the others, resulting in better overall performance.\n",

    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): In this technique, multiple models are trained on different subsets of the training data, and the results are combined to make a final prediction. This method reduces the variance of the model and makes it more robust to noise in the data.\n",
