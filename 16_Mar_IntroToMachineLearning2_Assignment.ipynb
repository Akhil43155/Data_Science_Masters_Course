    "Overfitting and underfitting are two common problems that can occur in machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and has learned the training data too well, to the point where it memorizes the noise and idiosyncrasies of the training data instead of learning the underlying pattern. This results in poor performance when the model is applied to new data, as it is too specific to the training data and cannot generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying pattern in the training data, resulting in poor performance both on the training data and on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consequences of overfitting are that the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new data, as it has essentially just memorized the training data. The model may also be overly sensitive to noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization. The consequences of underfitting are that the model performs poorly both on the training data and on new data, as it is too simple to capture the underlying pattern in the data.\n",

    "To mitigate overfitting, several techniques can be employed such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: This is the process of adding a penalty term to the loss function to discourage the model from overfitting. Examples of regularization methods include L1 and L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Augmentation: This involves generating new training data by transforming the existing data, such as flipping images horizontally or rotating them.\n",

    "\n",
    "Dropout: This involves randomly dropping out some neurons during training to prevent the model from relying too heavily on any one feature.\n",
