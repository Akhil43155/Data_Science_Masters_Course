    "A database is an organized collection of data that can be accessed, managed, and updated easily. A database provides a mechanism for storing, managing, and retrieving data in a structured and efficient manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two types of database management systems that differ in their data models, structure, and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases use a relational model, which organizes data into tables with a fixed schema (i.e., a set of predefined columns and data types). SQL databases use SQL as a standard language to manipulate and query data. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. SQL databases are best suited for handling structured data, which is data that has a well-defined schema and can be easily stored in tables. SQL databases are widely used for financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and data-driven applications that require high consistency, data integrity, and transactional support.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use a non-relational or distributed data model that can handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. NoSQL databases offer flexible schema models, which allow for dynamic and fast changes to the data structure. NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, which means they can handle a large number of concurrent users and massive amounts of data. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase. NoSQL databases are best suited for handling unstructured data, such as social media data, sensor data, and log data, which cannot be easily represented in a structured form.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are their data models, consistency, scalability, and schema flexibility. SQL databases are best suited for handling structured data that requires high consistency and transactional support, while NoSQL databases are ideal for handling unstructured data that requires high scalability and performance."

    "In a relational database, a primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table, and is used to enforce data integrity and consistency. A primary key can be made up of one or more columns, and must be unique for each row in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key, on the other hand, is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to establish relationships between tables in a relational database. The foreign key creates a link between two tables, allowing records in one table to reference records in another table. By creating this link, you can ensure data integrity and consistency across related tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two tables: \"orders\" and \"customers\". The \"orders\" table has a foreign key column \"customer_id\" that references the primary key column \"id\" in the \"customers\" table. This allows each order in the \"orders\" table to be associated with a customer in the \"customers\" table. If a customer is deleted from the \"customers\" table, all orders associated with that customer can be automatically deleted or set to null, depending on the database settings.\n",
