Descriptive statistics include measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range.\n",

Inferential statistics include techniques such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.\n",
    "Example: Inferential statistics might be used to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean income of two different groups of people, such as men and women. A sample of data from each group would be taken and analyzed to draw conclusions about the larger population of men and women."
