    "Multiprocessing is a way of running multiple processes in parallel, allowing multiple CPUs or CPU cores to work simultaneously on a problem. It is useful for improving the performance of computationally intensive programs, as well as for parallelizing I/O-bound programs that spend a lot of time waiting for input/output operations to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is particularly useful in Python because of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode at the same time. Multiprocessing allows multiple processes to run in parallel, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space, thereby bypassing the limitations of the GIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiprocessing module in Python provides a way to create and manage multiple processes in a straightforward and easy-to-use manner. It provides several features for communication and synchronization between processes, such as shared memory, pipes, and queues, as well as tools for managing the execution of multiple processes, such as pools and process groups.\n",

    "Architecture: Multiprocessing involves multiple processes, each with its own memory space and resources, while multithreading involves multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution: Multiprocessing involves executing multiple processes simultaneously on multiple CPUs or CPU cores, while multithreading involves executing multiple threads simultaneously on a single CPU or CPU core.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overhead: Multiprocessing has higher overhead due to the need to create and manage multiple processes, while multithreading has lower overhead as it only requires creating and managing multiple threads within a single process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interprocess communication: Multiprocessing requires interprocess communication mechanisms such as pipes, queues, or shared memory for communication between processes, while multithreading can communicate through shared variables or message passing without any additional mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Multiprocessing is more scalable as it can take advantage of multiple CPUs or CPU cores, while multithreading is less scalable as it is limited to the resources of a single CPU or CPU core.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multiprocessing is generally more complex due to the need to manage multiple processes and interprocess communication, while multithreading is simpler as it involves managing only multiple threads within a single process."

    "The multiprocessing pool module provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for parallel processing. It creates a pool of worker processes and distributes tasks among them. Each worker process can work on a task independently, and the results are collected and returned to the parent process. This can significantly reduce the processing time of CPU-bound tasks.\n",

    "The pool object has methods such as map, imap, apply, apply_async, and map_async, which can be used to apply a function to multiple input values concurrently. These methods create a queue of tasks to be executed and distribute them among the available worker processes.\n",
