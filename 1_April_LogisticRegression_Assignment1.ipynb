A logistic regression model can be used to model the relationship between these variables and estimate the probability of a customer buying the product based on their characteristics."

    "Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in logistic regression by adding a penalty term to the cost function that encourages the model to have smaller parameter values. The penalty term is a function of the magnitude of the parameter values, and it increases as the parameter values increase.\n",

    "\n",
    "L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function proportional to the absolute value of the parameter values. This encourages the model to have sparse parameter values, i.e., many parameter values become exactly zero. L1 regularization can be useful in feature selection, as it tends to identify and eliminate features that are not relevant to the prediction.\n",

    "L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function proportional to the square of the parameter values.

The ROC curve and AUC provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's ability to distinguish between the positive and negative cases, and they are useful in selecting the optimal classification threshold for the logistic regression model."

    "Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features (predictors) from a larger set of available features for use in a logistic regression model. Feature selection helps to improve the model's performance by reducing the number of irrelevant or redundant features, which can lead to overfitting, reduced model interpretability, and increased computational complexity.\n",

Another approach is to perform principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data and remove the collinear variables.\n",

One approach to address this issue is to use imputation techniques to estimate the missing values based on the values of the other predictor variables.

    "Non-linearity: Logistic regression models assume a linear relationship between the predictor variables and the log odds of the outcome variable.

Another approach is to use cross-validation techniques to select the optimal model parameters and assess the generalization performance of the model.\n",
