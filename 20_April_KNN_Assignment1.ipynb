    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by first training on a dataset of labeled examples. When given a new unlabeled data point, KNN identifies the K nearest data points from the training dataset, based on some distance metric (such as Euclidean distance), and assigns a label to the new data point based on the majority label of its nearest neighbors.\n",

    "The value of K is an important hyperparameter that needs to be chosen before training the algorithm. A larger value of K means that the decision boundaries are smoother and less complex, but it can also lead to misclassification when the decision boundaries are not well-defined. A smaller value of K can lead to overfitting and poor generalization to new data."
