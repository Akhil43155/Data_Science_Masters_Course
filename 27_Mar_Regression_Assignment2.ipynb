    "\n",
    "R-squared ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit between the independent and dependent variables. An R-squared value of 0 means that none of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s), while an R-squared value of 1 means that all of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s).\n",

    "R-squared can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared = 1 - (sum of squared residuals / total sum of squares)\n",

Additionally, R-squared should not be used as the sole criterion for selecting a regression model, as a model with a high R-squared value may still be overfitting the data or may not be appropriate for predicting new data."

    "Adjusted R-squared is more appropriate to use when comparing linear regression models that have different numbers of independent variables. Regular R-squared is affected by the number of independent variables in the model, with larger numbers of variables leading to artificially inflated R-squared values even if the additional variables do not improve the model's predictive power. Adjusted R-squared takes into account the number of independent variables in the model and penalizes the inclusion of unnecessary variables, providing a more accurate measure of the model's goodness of fit.\n",

    "Adjusted R-squared is particularly useful when building models that have a large number of independent variables or when using automated procedures to build models that include many potential predictors. In such cases, regular R-squared may be misleading, as it may suggest a better fit than is actually the case due to the inclusion of unnecessary variables.
