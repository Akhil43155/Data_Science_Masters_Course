The MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values, which is a suitable metric for evaluating the performance of an SVM regression model in predicting house prices based on multiple characteristics. By minimizing the MSE, we can ensure that the SVM regression model is accurately predicting house prices with as little error as possible."
