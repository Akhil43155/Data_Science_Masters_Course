    "For example, consider a simple experiment of flipping a fair coin once. The possible outcomes are either a \"heads\" or \"tails\", and each outcome has an equal probability of 0.5. The PMF of this experiment would assign a probability of 0.5 to \"heads\" and 0.5 to \"tails\".\n",

    "A Probability Density Function (PDF) is used for continuous random variables, which means that the possible outcomes of the experiment are uncountable and infinite.

The total area under the curve of the PDF is equal to 1.\n",
