    "\n",
    "\tAbstraction: Abstraction refers to the ability to focus on the essential features of an object, \n",
    "    ignoring the details that are not relevant. This allows the implementation of objects to change \n",
    "    over time without affecting the way they are used in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tEncapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and behavior within an object, making the \n",
    "    object a self-contained unit. This allows objects to be treated as black boxes, hiding their \n",
    "    implementation details from the rest of the program and promoting code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tInheritance: Inheritance allows a new class to be created by inheriting properties and behaviors from \n",
    "    an existing class. This makes it possible to define new classes that are related to existing ones, \n",
    "    reducing the amount of code that needs to be written and promoting code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tPolymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms. This allows \n",
    "    objects of different classes to be used interchangeably in the same program, making it possible to \n",
    "    write code that is more flexible and adaptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these four pillars form the foundation of OOP and provide a structure for organizing code into objects that can interact with each other in well-defined ways, making it easier to build complex, flexible, and scalable software applications."
