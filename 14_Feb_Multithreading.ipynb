    "\n",
    "join(): This method is used to block the calling thread until the thread that called the method has completed. When a thread calls the join() method of another thread, the calling thread waits until the other thread has finished executing its code. This method is useful when you want to wait for a thread to complete before continuing with the rest of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "isAlive(): This method is used to check whether a thread is still executing or has completed its code. When called on a thread object, it returns a boolean value indicating whether the thread is currently alive or not. If the thread has completed its execution, the method returns False, otherwise it returns True. This method is useful when you want to check the status of a thread before continuing with your program."

    "Advantages of Multithreading:\n",

    "Increased responsiveness: Multithreading allows a program to respond to user inputs faster by running tasks in the background while the main thread is still running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient use of resources: Multithreading can improve the efficiency of a program by using multiple threads to perform different tasks simultaneously, making better use of CPU resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Faster execution: Multithreading can speed up the execution of a program by dividing a large task into smaller sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplified code: Multithreading can simplify the code of a program by separating different tasks into separate threads, making it easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreading can increase the complexity of a program by requiring synchronization between threads, which can introduce bugs and make the code harder to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overhead: Multithreading can introduce overhead in the form of context switching and synchronization, which can slow down a program's execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging: Debugging multithreaded programs can be difficult due to race conditions, deadlocks, and other synchronization issues that can occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource contention: Multithreading can result in resource contention, where multiple threads compete for the same resources, which can lead to inefficiencies and slowdowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, multithreading can provide several benefits to a program, such as increased responsiveness, efficient resource usage, faster execution, and simplified code. However, it also has some drawbacks, including increased complexity, overhead, debugging difficulties, and resource contention."
