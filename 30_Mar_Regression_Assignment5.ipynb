    "Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization methods to handle multicollinearity and feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Elastic Net Regression, the cost function includes both L1 and L2 regularization terms, where L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficients. By combining these two regularization methods, Elastic Net Regression can achieve both feature selection and model stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other regression techniques such as ordinary least squares regression, Ridge regression, and Lasso regression, Elastic Net Regression provides a balance between the two methods, which can handle multicollinearity and sparsity simultaneously. Ridge regression shrinks all coefficients towards zero by adding a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficients, which may not result in sparse solutions, whereas Lasso regression can create sparse solutions, but it may not work well in the presence of multicollinearity. In contrast, Elastic Net Regression can handle both multicollinearity and sparsity."

    "To choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression, one can use techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, or randomized search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is a technique that involves partitioning the data into multiple subsets and using each subset for both training and testing the model. By doing so, one can estimate the performance of the model on new data and select the optimal values of the regularization parameters that result in the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search is a technique that involves creating a grid of possible values for each of the regularization parameters and evaluating the model for each combination of values. This can be computationally expensive, but it can be effective in finding the optimal values of the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized search is similar to grid search, but instead of evaluating all possible combinations, it randomly samples values for each parameter and evaluates the model for each combination. This can be less computationally expensive than grid search and can still be effective in finding the optimal values of the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it is recommended to perform cross-validation to choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters as it provides a more reliable estimate of the model's performance on new data."
